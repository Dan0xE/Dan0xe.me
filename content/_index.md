Hi there!

I'm a fullstack engineer at <a href="https://mybits.de">BITS GmbH</a> and
part-time security researcher at <a href="https://xang.engineering">Xang
Engineering</a>.

I work on systems programming, full-stack development, and reverse engineering,
building tools ranging from VST plugins at
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/samplehorn">Samplehorn</a> to web and native
applications.

I primarily use Rust and Go, along with TypeScript and React.

I occasionally write about my open-source work and development experiences or
other things I find interesting.

You can find my projects, music and writing through the links above.
